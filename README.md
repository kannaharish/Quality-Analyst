1. Static testing:
          
Static Testing is a software testing technique in which the software is tested without executing the code. 
             
Static testing started in early stage of software development life cycle. 
Under static testing code is not executed rather it checks manually.
The main aim of this testing is to improve the quality of the software or an application.
 Static testing is done during verification process.
 Static testing also used to preventing the defects.
 Static testing can be done before a completion of coding.
 During static testing we can find out less number of defects

1.1 Static testing technique:

   1.Informal review
This is one of the type of review which doesn't follow any process to find errors in the document. Under this technique, you just review the document and give informal comments on it.
It is a kind of cross-read by one or more colleagues.
Very common type of review it will take less effort 
   2.Technical review
Which is led by a trained moderator and also lead by the Technical expert with No management participation.
 Technical review inform the participant about technical content of the document.
   3.Walk through
It is not a formal process .
The author of the work product explains the product to his team. 
Participants can ask questions if any Meeting is led by the author. 
Suitable for small teams.
It is especially useful for high level documents like requirement specification
   4.Inspection 
Most formal review process .
The main purpose is to find defects and meeting is led by trained moderator . 
During Inspection the document are prepared and checked carefully by the reviewers before meeting.
A separate preparation is carried out during which the products is examined and the defects are found
Which is led by trained moderator and use entry and exit criteria 
It remove the defect efficiently and early as possible
Improve the product quality


2. Dynamic Testing:
              
This testing is used to test the software or an application by executing it.
Dynamic testing is done during validation process.
Dynamic testing is used to finding and fixing the bug.
Dynamic testing done after a completion of coding.
During dynamic testing we can find out more number of defects.




2.1 Dynamic testing technique:
                 
1. Unit testing 
Every individual and independent module are testing in this phase.
2. Integration testing
After a completion of unit test every single module and combined together and checks the communication between the module.    
They are 3 types 
            1.Top down approach=done with the help of stubs.
            2.Bottom up approach=done with the help of drivers.
            3.Big bang 
3. System testing
The complete system has been tested over here.


4. Acceptance testing
               1.Alpha testing
               2.Beta testing 
Both the static and dynamic testing are used to improve the quality of the software or an application.
                 
3.Agile
Agile is one kind of development method. 
Now a days the more software companies working in this method.
There is no need of documentation done over here.
 In this method the customer requirement are specified in one line user stories. 
From these stories based on the knowledge fix the number of days need to complete the task for example user login page (1 day).
After fixing the days to the module then assign the priority to the module based on the customer requirement
Then we can start our project execution scrum master is the person who fixes the number of days to each sprint. 
In agile method analysis, design, code, testing is the continuous activity.
Agile the quality has been improved because the testing has been started from the day one it self.
Customer are also happy because if any changes in the application means the team update the change with out asking any cost.
 Agile model encourage the face to face communication rather than the written statement.

4. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MANUAL AND AUTOMATION	
				
                 MANUAL TESTING
             AUTOMATION TESTING
1. It can be done manually with the help of test case
 It can be done with help of automation tools example: Qtp , Jmeter, Selenium,
2. The tester no need to have a programming language
 The tester must have a programming language
3. It takes lot of time
 It takes less time
4. It is consider as a low quality results
 It is consider as a high quality results
5. It can be done without interaction of tools
 It can be done only by tool
6. More human efforts
 Less human efforts
7.We cannot check the application with multiple platform using minimum number of users
its depends on humans
 We can check the application with multiple platform using minimum number of users
its depends on tools
8.Manual testing requires less cost than automation testing
Initial cost of automation testing is more then manual testing.
9.It is consider as  less reliable
It is consider as a more reliable

5. TESTING
Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its components with the intent to find whether it satisfies and specifies the specified requirements or not.

6. WHY SHOULD WE DO TESTING
 We do testing to give better quality to the product we test the product whether it is meeting the client/customer requirements or not.
 To Improve the quality of the software.
